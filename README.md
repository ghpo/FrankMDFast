<h1 align="center">FrankMDFast</h1>

<p align="center">
  A native Rust desktop rewrite of <a href="https://github.com/akitaonrails/FrankMD">FrankMD</a>,
  built with GPUI + gpui-kit and designed to fit in on Omarchy.<br>
  It aims to be a drop-in replacement: same <code>.fed</code> file, same environment variables, same notes on disk.

## Install

FrankMDFast is the desktop version of [FrankMD](https://github.com/akitaonrails/FrankMD). Keep using
FrankMD if you want to reach your notes from a browser or another machine; use FrankMDFast if you only
need a desktop app. Both work on the same notes folder and `.fed` file. The command is `frankmdfast`.

Download the package for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/akitaonrails/FrankMDFast/releases):
the AppImage or tarball on Linux, the DMG on macOS, the installer or zip on Windows.
On Arch Linux: `yay -S frankmdfast-bin`.

## Remote access (Tailscale)

FrankMDFast can serve the same vault to a browser on another machine on your
Tailscale network:

```bash
FRANKMD_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)" frankmdfast --serve-only ~/notes
# open http://<tailscale-ip>:8787 and paste the token
```

`--serve` keeps the desktop window and starts the server too. The default bind
is the Tailscale address; `0.0.0.0` requires `--serve-bind-any`. A token of at
least 32 bytes is mandatory. See [docs/remote.md](docs/remote.md) for the
security model, API and a systemd unit.

## Status

Every domain crate is implemented and passes its ported FrankMD tests and golden cases. The GPUI
app has the shell, the editor, the native preview and the dialogs (files, media/AI, insert).
Development happens on `master`; CI builds every push.

```
cargo test --workspace     # 2901 tests
cargo run -- ~/notes       # open a notes folder (or a single note)
```

Known gaps: relative line numbers; typed insert-mode text after `cw` takes a second undo; Hebrew
has no right-to-left layout yet (GPUI has no bidi); settings "Test connection" buttons; secrets
in the global config file are plain text (0600), with no keyring yet. On Windows a second launch
opens a new window instead of reusing the running app. The full test suite runs on Linux; Windows
CI also runs the Windows-only path and vault tests, and macOS CI checks that it builds.

## Releases

Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, optionally add `releases/vX.Y.Z.md` (used as the release notes),
then push the tag `vX.Y.Z`. `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds:

| Platform | Files |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64, aarch64 | `frankmdfast-X.Y.Z-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`, `FrankMDFast-X.Y.Z-<arch>.AppImage` |
| macOS (universal) | `FrankMDFast-X.Y.Z-macos-universal.dmg` |
| Windows x86_64 | `frankmdfast-X.Y.Z-windows-x86_64.zip`, `FrankMDFast-X.Y.Z-windows-x86_64-setup.exe` |
| Arch Linux | AUR package `frankmdfast-bin`, pushed after the GitHub release |

Running the workflow by hand builds everything as artifacts without publishing. Signing,
notarization and the AUR push are optional and turn on when their secrets exist:

| Secret | Used for |
|---|---|
| `AUR_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Pushing `frankmdfast-bin` to the AUR |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE`, `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `MACOS_SIGNING_IDENTITY` | Developer ID signing (base64 `.p12`) |
| `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Notarizing the DMG |
| `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`, `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Authenticode signing (base64 `.pfx`) |

Packaging scripts live in `packaging/` and run locally too, e.g.
`packaging/linux/package.sh 0.1.0 x86_64 target/release/frankmdfast dist`.

## How the rewrite is checked against the original

1. **Ported tests.** Every logic and integration test from FrankMD's Ruby and JS suites is ported
   one for one. Each carries a `// port: <original file>:<line> "<name>"` comment.
   Rails-only tests are listed as skipped, with the reason. Per-area tables are in `docs/testing/port-*.md`.
2. **Recorded outputs.** `tests/fixtures/golden/` holds 7,534 input/output cases (53 files)
   produced by running the original Ruby and JS code. They cover the byte-exact `.fed` template,
   config resolution, paths, Hugo slugs, search and the markdown pipeline.
   `tools/golden/regen_all.sh` regenerates them from a FrankMD checkout.
3. **UI tests.** The 1,418 browser/system tests are adapted to the new design in
   `docs/testing/ui-test-plan.md`. Most become GUI-free view-model tests; the rest run headless in GPUI.

## Decisions so far

| Decision | Why |
|---|---|
| GPUI + gpui-kit `=0.9.0` (exact pin) | Chosen over GTK4. Weekly breaking 0.x releases, so only `frankmd-app` depends on it |
| Config resolves `.fed` > ENV > default, exactly as the original | Drop-in compatibility |
| Theme and language follow Omarchy live unless `.fed` (or the global config / ENV) pins them | Picking "Follow Omarchy" or "System" in the pickers removes the pin. Language order: explicit setting > `~/.config/omarchy/language` > `LC_*`/`LANG` > English |
| Interface size (80–200%) is an app preference in `~/.local/state/frankmdfast/prefs.json`, not a `.fed` key | It belongs to the machine, and FrankMD's `.fed` schema stays unchanged |
| Recent files stay in `.fed`; Hugo dates stay UTC | Same on-disk behavior, so switching between the two apps keeps your history |
| Drafts keyed by stable note ID, not path | Fixes the path-as-identity bug class from the history. Browser drafts were never readable by a desktop app anyway |
| Omarchy theme from `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme/colors.toml` | The original's path no longer exists, so its theme sync is broken today |
| No RTL mirroring in v1 | GPUI has no bidi yet. The original never mirrored either, so nothing regresses |
| Vim is our own state-machine crate | gpui-kit's editor has no vim layer |
| Delete goes to the system trash | Also fixes the original's failing delete of non-empty folders |
| Preview line mapping and Dockerfile highlighting fixed | Both were bugs in the original |

### Security decisions (diverge from the original on purpose)

Security comes first. Where the original's behavior is unsafe, we change it and mark the affected
tests and recorded cases with `// security:`.

- **Uploads accept only real media files.** Content is sniffed (magic bytes) and must match an allowed
  image/video type. The extension alone is not trusted.
- **URLs with userinfo (`user:pass@host`) are rejected** by the egress policy.
- **AI requests never include config or secrets.** The grammar check only accepts markdown note content and
  refuses `.fed` and other non-note files.
- **In-app `.fed` editing stays blocked** (as in the original since its security fix). Settings are edited
  through the Settings sheet, which never displays stored secrets.

  frankmd-config     .fed parse/write-back, ENV, resolution
  frankmd-theme      built-in, custom and Omarchy themes
  frankmd-i18n       reads the Rails YAML locales unchanged
  frankmd-markdown   marked port → IR for the native preview; HTML only as a test oracle
  frankmd-search     content search (Ruby regex semantics), find/replace
  frankmd-net        the one HTTP client, with egress (SSRF) policy
  frankmd-media      uploads, S3, library, usage, image/video search
  frankmd-ai         grammar fix and image generation across 5 providers
  frankmd-vim        vim state machine
  frankmd-watch      notes dir + Omarchy theme watching
  frankmd-workspace  app state, autosave, drafts, commands (GUI-free view models)
  frankmd-app        GPUI shell
  frankmd-testkit    test helpers for the recorded outputs
assets/              reused FrankMD assets
packaging/           Linux (tarball, AppImage), macOS, Windows and AUR packaging
tests/fixtures/      recorded outputs from the original
tools/               generators for fixtures and assets
